The goal is to predict the future sale price of houses in London based on a range of features that capture the characteristics of the property and the context of the sale. The dataset includes various attributes of each property such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, property type, size, geographical location, and energy rating. Additionally, each sale transaction is time-stamped with the month and year of sale, providing an opportunity to incorporate temporal trends into the predictions.

Description

Given the current state of the housing market and the features of each property, participants should:

1.Develop a regression model to predict future house prices based on the provided features.

2.Account for seasonal, regional, and market-specific trends that could affect property prices over time.

3.Handle missing data, outliers, and multicollinearity to improve model performance.

4.Provide insights into which factors most significantly affect house prices in London.
